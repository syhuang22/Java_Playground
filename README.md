# Java Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing Java, focusing on various core topics including basic usage, design patterns, multithreading, exception handling, and data structures. The aim is to build a solid understanding of Java fundamentals as well as advanced features.

## Basic Usage

In this section, you will find basic Java programs that demonstrate syntax, operators, data types, and control flow. These examples serve as a foundation for understanding how Java works.

### Examples
- **Hello World** - Basic program to get started with Java.
- **Variables and Types** - Examples showing different data types in Java.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. This section covers various design patterns and their implementation in Java.

### Patterns Covered
- **Singleton** - Ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Observer** - A way of notifying change to a number of classes to ensure consistency between the classes.
- **Factory** - Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

## Multithreading

Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming. This section explores creating, managing, and synchronizing threads in Java.

### Topics
- **Creating Threads** - Using `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.
- **Synchronization** - Techniques to control the access of multiple threads to common resources.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling is crucial for dealing with runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

### Key Concepts
- **Try-Catch Block** - Catch exceptions and handle them gracefully.
- **Throwing Exceptions** - Manually throwing an exception.
- **Custom Exceptions** - Creating your own exception classes.

## Data Structures

Understanding data structures is vital for designing efficient algorithms. This section includes implementations of various data structures in Java.

### Data Structures Implemented
- **LinkedList** - A sequence of elements where each element links to its successor.
- **HashMap** - An efficient way of storing and retrieving data using key-value pairs.
- **Stacks and Queues** - Typical data structures for managing elements in LIFO and FIFO manners respectively.
